# abd.py #
This script will calculate the proportion of each base at a given position for multiple sequences of the same length. The output is an excel file containing line plots displaying the proportion for each base.

# File requirements #
The input file should be a tab delimited file with at least two columns: 
   1. A column containing one sequence per row. The sequences can be of any length, but they all have to be of the same length.
   2. A column with expression/ fold change or any type of numerical data to sort the file and thereby the column with the sequences.

# Behavior #
The file will be sorted by a column of choice (e.g. peak enrichment, fold changes, p-values, etc). 
  * This is useful when interested in the composition of the underlying DNA sequence of high/low affinity binding sites, for example. 

 * Bullet list item 2
